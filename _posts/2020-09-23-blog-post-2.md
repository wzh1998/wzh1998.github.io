I made a mistake while implementing [LeetCode 49.Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/), so I wrote this page to record it. The final AC code is shown below.

```
class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> groupAnagrams(String[] strs) {
        Map<String, List<String>> hashmap = new HashMap<> ();
        for(int i = 0; i < strs.length; i++) {
        	char[] sequence = new char[26];
        	for(int j = 0; j < strs[i].length(); j++) {
        		sequence[strs[i].charAt(j) - 'a']++;
        	}
        	String key = Arrays.toString(sequence);
        	if(!hashmap.containsKey(key)) hashmap.put(key, new ArrayList<String> ());
        	hashmap.get(key).add(strs[i]);
        }
        return new ArrayList<> (hashmap.values());
    }
}
```
Initially, I wrote line 10 as String key = sequence.toString(); and I find that the key is some thing like "C@27082746" and after changing it with toString method in Arrays class, the result becomes normal. 

The reason is because sequence.toString() method is defined in Object class (superclass of every other java classes), and the definition of this method is shown below:

```

/**
 * Returns a string representation of the object. In general, the 
 * <code>toString</code> method returns a string that 
 * "textually represents" this object. The result should 
 * be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a 
 * person to read.
 * It is recommended that all subclasses override this method.
 * <p>
 * The <code>toString</code> method for class <code>Object</code> 
 * returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the 
 * object is an instance, the at-sign character `<code>@</code>', and 
 * the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the 
 * object. In other words, this method returns a string equal to the 
 * value of:
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * getClass().getName() + '@' + Integer.toHexString(hashCode())
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * @return  a string representation of the object.
 */
public String toString() {
return getClass().getName() + "@" + Integer.toHexString(hashCode());

```

See? the returned result is not the string that we expected, it is "variable type character + a tring of hash value". So next time when you want to transform an array to string, use Arrays.toString! If you want to use toString method in your own class, remember to override the toString method that you inherited from Object class.
