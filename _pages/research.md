Research Interest
------
I am specifically interested in distributed coordination within multi-robot systems. Imagine that, in the near future, when a smart refrigerator detects that there is insufficient food, it will automatically send an order to the supermarket. A wheeled robot will open the door, taking the ingredients to a cooking robot. When the owners come home after work, they can immediately enjoy a delicious dinner. After the meal, the wheeled robot will then take the dishes to an automatic dishwasher.
