I am a final year undergraduate student in _[University College Dublin](http://www.ucd.ie/)_ and _[Beijing University of Technology]()_. My undergraduate programme [BDIC] is co-organized by the above two schools, core modules are delivered and examined in the medium of English by UCD lecturers. I am expected to get an EU honours degree (First Class Honours expected) from UCD and a CN bachelor's degree from BJUT on July, 2020.
